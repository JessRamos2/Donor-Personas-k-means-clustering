# Donor-Personas-k-means-clustering

As a team of volunteer data scientists, we cleaned and transformed a dataset from a nonprofit client containing donor demographics, behavior, and donations. Then we conducted a k-means clustering analysis to group donors which resulted in 3 significant clusters. 


I took these clusters and developed 3 donor personas based on their demographics and historical behaviors and presented them to the client and other Data Science and Analytics leaders in Atlanta.
